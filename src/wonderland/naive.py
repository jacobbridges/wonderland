"""
Having trouble wrapping my head around how to make an event based library
  without websockets. I want the wonderland module to be decoupled from the
  serving mechanism. So I decided to start with a naive approach and iterate
  upon it.

Before you criticize - I know. I should use queues instead of lists, or
  ThreadPools instead of a single Thread, or maybe grab a quality event library
  off the shelf instead of home-brewing this disaster. This is my process, get
  over it.

Events ========================================================================

In an event-based system, it makes sense there would be lots of events.

I don't love the idea of each action from the user resulting in a custom event 
  class. My prediction is that it will get very cluttered, very quickly.
  However, the upside is that events are easily distinguishable. An alternative
  could be a `code` attribute on every event which is unique, but then I would
  need to have an enum of event codes somewhere in the system.
  
I also don't love the idea of "Input" events vs "Output" events, but perhaps 
  that is because I am new to event based programming. Essentially I want to 
  identify two different streams: events being sent to the server, and events
  being sent to the client.
